# Databases-NTUA
This repository is the Semester Project of Databases of ECE NTUA.

We were asked to develop a functional DB that could be used in a cooking competition.

Used MySQLWorkbench for designing the DB

Python for filling the DB with data

DDL, DML, E-R Diagram and Relational Diagram of the DB can be found in the appropriate directories
